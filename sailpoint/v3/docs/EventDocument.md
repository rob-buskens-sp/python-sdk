# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of EventDocument from a JSON string
event_document_instance = EventDocument.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print EventDocument.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
event_document_dict = event_document_instance.to_dict()
